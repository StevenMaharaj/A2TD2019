# Periodic measurements of salinity and water flow were taken in North Carolinaâ€™s Pamlico Sound, re-
# sulting in the following data (x = water flow, y = salinity):

# (a) Read the data into R and produce a suitable graphical summary (with meaningful labels) of the
# relationship between water flow and salinity.
# (b) Write down an appropriate statistical model for examining the relationship, and fit the model in
# R. Use the regression output to determine the correlation coefficient between x and y.
# (c) Examine appropriate diagnostic plots, and comment on anything that is noteworthy or that may
# challenge the assumptions of the model.
# (d) Find a 99% confidence interval for the slope of the line. Comment on the usefulness or otherwise
# of the estimated slope and intercept.
# (e) Find a 95% prediction interval for the salinity when the water flow is 21. Explain its meaning.
